# oliv

oliv is a dark VSCode theme heavily influenced by [Ayu](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu) Dark for editor colors 
and [Jelly Beans](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim) for syntax colors.

Language support for snytax highlighting is very limited: 

- C++
- Python
- -some- CMake

Might support Lua in the future but it's also quite likely that support for other languages may stay as is indefinetely.

oliv does not have a light version.

### Install

Once you clone the repo, open VSCode and run ``` >Extensions: Install from VSIX... ``` and select the vsix provided. 
You can also modify oliv and run ``` vsce package ``` to package your changes into a vsix.
